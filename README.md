Below are some of the tasks you should embark upon to prepare your home ahead of our rat removal or other pest control service.

## Exterior Preparation
Certain pests find your exterior area to be favorable for them. Whether you are dealing with a raccoon problem, bird problem, termite problem, or others, you need to prepare the exterior area ahead of our pest control service. To get this done, focus on the following:

- Mow your lawns and trim the vegetation. If you have trees installed, now may be the right time to trim and prune

-	All beddings and linens are properly washed and dried
-	Bag up all clothing items before the pest control service is started
-	Set up a temporary containment for all travel luggage coming into your home
